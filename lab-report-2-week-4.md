# Lab Report 2, Week 4.

Below, I will pick three code changes that my group worked on in order to fix a 
bug; these were stored on 
[Jared's repo](https://github.com/jared-hughes/markdown-parse) which I pulled and
merged into my own for this lab report. 

To get the images of the symptoms of the failure-inducing input, I revert back to
previous versions of the Java file with `commit`

## 
Show a screenshot of the code change diff from Github (a page like this)
Link to the test file for a failure-inducing input that prompted you to make that change
Show the symptom of that failure-inducing input by showing the output of running the file at the command line for the version where it was failing (this should also be in the commit message history)
Write 2-3 sentences describing the relationship between the bug, the symptom, and the failure-inducing input.
