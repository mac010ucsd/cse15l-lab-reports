# Lab report 1, Week 2.
![]()
You will write a tutorial for incoming 15L students (and your future self!) about how to log into a course-specific account on ieng6. Your post should include the steps you took, along with screenshots of what each step looked like. You’re free to use the screenshots you took for lab 1, or new ones. Complete any steps you didn’t complete in your group on your own.

Overall, make sure you have at least 6 screenshots, one for each of the steps below (though more is useful, remember that this will help out your future self). For each step include 2-3 sentences or bullet points describing what you did.

## Installing VScode

## Remotely Connecting
## Trying Some Commands
## Moving Files with scp
## Setting an SSH Key
## Optimizing Remote Running
