# Lab Report 1, Week 2.
You will write a tutorial for incoming 15L students (and your future self!) about how to log into a course-specific account on ieng6. Your post should include the steps you took, along with screenshots of what each step looked like. You’re free to use the screenshots you took for lab 1, or new ones. Complete any steps you didn’t complete in your group on your own.

Overall, make sure you have at least 6 screenshots, one for each of the steps below (though more is useful, remember that this will help out your future self). For each step include 2-3 sentences or bullet points describing what you did.

## Installing VScode
First, download the VSCode installer for whichever platform you will be using, from the official [VSCode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

After running through the installer and all of the steps it tells you to do, you should be able to launch the application. At this point, you will be greeted with a mostly-blank screen which should look something like this:

## Remotely Connecting
First, we should open the terminal. This can be done by either clicking (on the top bar) `terminal`->`new terminal` or by using the keyboard shortcut `ctrl`+`shift`+`grave` which works on both Windows and Mac.

A bar will pop up at the bottom, which is the terminal. Depending on whether you use a Mac or a Windows machine, it may look a little bit different from the screenshots (all the following screenshots will have been run on a Mac device).

## Trying Some Commands
Some useful commands that we can use are listed here:
```
grep <phrase> <file>
	returns the line at which the phrase appears in the file
ls
	lists all of the files in the directory that are not hidden
ls -a
	lists all of the files, even those that are hidden
ssh <address>
	uses secure shell to connect to a server
```
